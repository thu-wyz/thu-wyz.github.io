I am Yangzhen Wu (伍垟圳), a third year student major in Computer Science at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/), Tsinghua University. (a.k.a **Yao Class**, directed by the Turing Award Laureate Andrew Chi-Chih Yao).

Currently I'm visiting Carnegie Mellon University, as an intern advised by [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). I also work closely with [Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/).

My current research interests lie in the following areas:
- Maching Learning for code and math.
- Reasoning abilities of large language models.
- Inference algorithms and their scalability.
